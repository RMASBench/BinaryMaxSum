/**
 * Factor that selects the best active neighbor but doesn't constraint others. This is very similar
 * to the {@link SelectorFactor}, but in this case other neighbors are allowed to be active
 * at the same time (without an increase in utility).
 * <p/>
 * Formally, this factor is defined over a sequence of neighbors <em>X = {x_1, ..., x_n}</em> and a
 * sequence of corresponding weights <em>B = {b_1, ..., b_n}, b_i > 0</Ã«m>. Then, the factor is
 * defined as
 * <pre>
 *      f(X,B) = max_{i=1..n} b_i*x_i
